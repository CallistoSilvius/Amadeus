# Amadeus Chatbot

Amadeus is a locally hosted AI chatbot powered by LLaMA 2, designed to provide an interactive conversational experience. This chatbot runs offline on your machine, ensuring privacy and control over your AI interactions. It is built using Python, Streamlit for the UI, and Pyttsx3 for text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities.
